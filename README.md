# My First Website

This is my very first website project, built from scratch as I begin my journey into web development. It is a simple single-page website where each section is displayed individually as you scroll, ensuring a clean and focused experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A sticky navbar that highlights the current section.
- **Section-by-Section Display**: Each section is displayed individually on the screen, avoiding overlap.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code**: Designed and coded with simplicity in mind.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Added functionality for smooth scrolling and active section highlighting.

## Project Goals

1. Learn the basics of web development.
2. Practice structuring HTML and CSS.
3. Implement JavaScript for interactive elements.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
